# Price Alert Notification System

## Overview

The Price Alert system automatically detects price drops whenever a user re-scrapes a keyword they have searched before. It requires **zero configuration** from the user — alerts are generated and displayed in real time via a bell icon in the navbar.

## How It Works — Step by Step

### Step 1 — First scrape (baseline)

The user searches for a keyword (e.g. `"pc"`). The Celery task `run_search_pipeline` scrapes all requested platforms, saves `RawPrice` records to the database, and marks the search as `completed`.

At this point there is no previous search to compare against, so no alerts are created.

### Step 2 — Re-scrape the same keyword

The user searches for the same keyword again on a different date. The scrape pipeline runs again. Once it completes and the search is marked `completed`, the pipeline immediately calls:

```python
from .price_alerts import check_price_drops
check_price_drops(user=search.user, new_search=search)
```

### Step 3 — Drop detection (`price_alerts.py`)

`check_price_drops` does the following:

1. **Find previous search** — queries for the most recent completed search by the same user with the same query (excluding the current one).
2. **Fetch both price sets** — loads `RawPrice` objects for both the old and new search.
3. **Match products** — for each product in the new results:
   - **Exact match**: normalize both titles (lowercase, strip punctuation and extra whitespace) and compare.
   - **Fuzzy match fallback**: if no exact match, use `difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, old_title, new_title).ratio() > 0.85` to catch minor title variations (e.g. different casing, extra spaces, punctuation changes).
4. **Calculate drop**:
   ```
   old_price_MAD = float(old.price) × old.exchange_rate
   new_price_MAD = float(new.price) × new.exchange_rate
   drop_amount   = old_price_MAD - new_price_MAD
   drop_percent  = (drop_amount / old_price_MAD) × 100
   ```
5. **Filter noise** — skip if `drop_amount < 1 MAD` (prevents floating-point false positives).
6. **Upsert alert** — checks if an unread `PriceAlert` already exists for the same user + product title + query:
   - **If yes**: delete it and recreate it with updated values and a refreshed `created_at` timestamp.
   - **If no**: create a new `PriceAlert`.
7. **Never crash the scrape** — the entire function is wrapped in `try/except Exception` with structured logging. A failure here has zero impact on the scrape response.

### Step 4 — Bell updates in real time

The `useAlerts` hook in the frontend polls `GET /api/search/alerts/` every **30 seconds**. As soon as new alerts exist, the bell badge updates automatically.

## Data Model

### `PriceAlert`

| Field           | Type          | Description                                    |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `user`          | FK → User     | Owner of the alert                             |
| `product_title` | CharField     | Raw product title from the scrape              |
| `old_price`     | Decimal       | Price in MAD at previous scrape                |
| `new_price`     | Decimal       | Price in MAD at latest scrape                  |
| `drop_amount`   | Decimal       | `old_price - new_price` in MAD                 |
| `drop_percent`  | Decimal       | `(drop_amount / old_price) × 100`              |
| `platform`      | CharField     | e.g. `avito`, `jumia`                          |
| `product_url`   | URLField      | Direct link to the product listing             |
| `search_query`  | CharField     | The keyword that triggered the alert           |
| `is_read`       | BooleanField  | `False` until the user clicks the alert card   |
| `created_at`    | DateTimeField | Auto-set; refreshed on upsert                  |

## API Reference

All endpoints are under `/api/search/` and require authentication (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

### `GET /api/search/alerts/`

Returns all price alerts for the authenticated user, ordered by most recent first.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "unread_count": 3,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "product_title": "Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15.6\" Intel Core i5",
      "old_price": "4500.00",
      "new_price": "3999.00",
      "drop_amount": "501.00",
      "drop_percent": "11.1",
      "platform": "jumia",
      "product_url": "https://www.jumia.ma/...",
      "search_query": "pc",
      "is_read": false,
      "created_at": "2025-05-08T14:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### `PATCH /api/search/alerts/{id}/read/`

Marks a single alert as read.

**Response:**
```json
{ "id": 42, "is_read": true }
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — alert not found or does not belong to the authenticated user.

---

### `PATCH /api/search/alerts/read-all/`

Marks all unread alerts for the authenticated user as read.

**Response:**
```json
{ "marked": 3 }
```

---

## Frontend Components

### `src/api/alerts.js`

Thin wrapper around the authenticated axios instance.

```js
alertsApi.getAlerts()          // GET  /api/search/alerts/
alertsApi.markAlertRead(id)    // PATCH /api/search/alerts/{id}/read/
alertsApi.markAllRead()        // PATCH /api/search/alerts/read-all/
```

---

### `src/hooks/useAlerts.js`

Custom React hook. Mount it once in any component that needs alert data.

| Return value    | Type       | Description                                      |
|----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `alerts`        | Array      | Full list of `PriceAlert` objects                |
| `unreadCount`   | Number     | Count of alerts where `is_read === false`        |
| `markRead(id)`  | Function   | Optimistically marks one alert as read           |
| `markAllRead()` | Function   | Optimistically marks all alerts as read          |
| `loading`       | Boolean    | `true` during initial fetch                      |
| `refresh()`     | Function   | Manually re-fetches (e.g. after a new scrape)    |

**Real-time Synchronization:**
The hook maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to `ws://<your-domain>/ws/alerts/`. Because native WebSockets do not support custom HTTP headers (such as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`), the JWT token is passed securely via the `?token=` query parameter. The backend's ASGI application is protected by a custom `TokenAuthMiddleware` which intercepts the connection request, extracts the query parameter, validates the JWT, and binds the authenticated user to the connection scope.

If the connection is successfully authenticated, any price drops detected by the backend Celery workers are instantly pushed to the frontend, automatically triggering a `refresh()` to update the UI without needing 30-second polling.

---

### `src/components/AlertBell.jsx`

Standalone bell icon component. Place it anywhere in the layout.

**Behavior:**
- Shows a **terracotta red badge** (`#C1502E`) with the unread count when `unreadCount > 0`.
- Clicking the bell toggles the dropdown.
- Clicking outside the dropdown closes it (via `mousedown` listener on `document`).

**Dropdown contents:**
- Header: "Price drops" label + "Mark all as read" button.
- Scrollable list (max 380px height) of alert cards:
  - Green `TrendingDown` icon background (`#EAF3DE` / `#3B6D11`)
  - Product title (truncated with ellipsis)
  - Old price ~~strikethrough~~ → new price + green savings pill (`-X MAD · -Y%`)
  - Platform, keyword, and time-ago timestamp
  - "View" link opening the product URL in a new tab
  - Red unread dot for unread alerts
  - Unread card background: `#F5F4F0`; read: `#fff`
- Empty state when no alerts exist.
- Footer with "View all alerts →" link (navigates to `/alerts`).

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Auto-detect, no config** | Users should not need to set up price alerts manually. The system infers intent from re-searching the same keyword. |
| **1 MAD minimum drop threshold** | Eliminates false positives caused by floating-point arithmetic in currency conversion. |
| **Upsert pattern (delete + recreate)** | Keeps only one unread alert per product per query, preventing inbox clutter on frequent re-scrapes. Refreshes `created_at` so the user always sees the latest comparison. |
| **`try/except` around entire function** | Alert generation is a non-critical side effect. A bug here must never surface to the user or fail the scrape response. |
| **30-second polling** | Simple and reliable without requiring WebSocket infrastructure for alerts specifically. |
| **Fuzzy matching at 0.85** | Conservative threshold — catches minor variations (e.g. `"Laptop HP 15"` vs `"Laptop HP 15-..."`) while avoiding false matches across different products. |

## Future Improvements

- [x] ~~Move `check_price_drops()` into a dedicated Celery async task~~ — done. `check_price_drops` is now a `@shared_task` dispatched with `.delay(search.id)` immediately after the scrape completes. It runs in the Celery worker process, retries up to 2 times on failure with a 30-second delay.
- [x] Add a `/alerts` full page for browsing and filtering all historical alerts.
- [ ] Support email notifications for significant price drops (e.g. > 20%).
- [ ] Allow users to set a minimum drop percentage threshold per keyword.
- [x] Add WebSocket push for instant bell updates instead of 30-second polling. `AlertConsumer` at `ws/alerts/` pushes `{ type: "new_alerts", unread_count: N }` to all open tabs for the user the moment the Celery task detects drops. The ASGI `TokenAuthMiddleware` ensures these payloads are only pushed to securely authenticated clients.
